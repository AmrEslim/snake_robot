# Robot Snake Movement Analysis

## Overview

This analysis examines the movement of a robot snake based on tracking data from two markers positioned on the head and tail of the robot. The data has been converted from meters to centimeters for better readability.

## Data Description

The original dataset contains 830 data points with the following measurements:
- Time in milliseconds
- Horizontal displacement (converted to cm)
- Vertical displacement (converted to cm)
- Horizontal speed (converted to cm/s)
- Vertical speed (converted to cm/s)

## Key Findings

### Displacement Ranges

**Horizontal Displacement:**
- Head: -2638.00 cm to 25.69 cm (Range: ~2663.69 cm)
- Tail: -2195.85 cm to 158.16 cm (Range: ~2354.01 cm)

**Vertical Displacement:**
- Head: -215.33 cm to 697.74 cm (Range: ~913.07 cm)
- Tail: -94.49 cm to 917.80 cm (Range: ~1012.29 cm)

### Average Positions

**Average Horizontal Displacement:**
- Head: -1483.12 cm
- Tail: -998.66 cm

**Average Vertical Displacement:**
- Head: 231.11 cm
- Tail: 386.62 cm

## Movement Patterns

1. **Horizontal Movement:**
   - The robot snake shows significant horizontal travel distance, with the head moving through a wider range than the tail.
   - The negative values in horizontal displacement indicate the snake is predominantly moving in the negative x-direction.

2. **Vertical Movement:**
   - The vertical displacement shows substantial undulation, characteristic of snake-like locomotion.
   - The tail exhibits a greater range of vertical movement than the head, suggesting that vertical waves propagate more prominently through the tail section.

3. **Head-Tail Coordination:**
   - The data reveals a phase difference between head and tail movements, indicating the propagation of waves along the snake's body.
   - The tail generally follows the path of the head with some delay, which is typical of serpentine locomotion.

## Visualization Notes

The interactive visualization provides multiple views of the data:

1. **Displacement Graphs:**
   - Show how the horizontal and vertical positions of both head and tail change over time.
   - Reveals the undulating motion pattern characteristic of snake locomotion.

2. **Trajectory View:**
   - Presents the path traced by the head and tail in 2D space.
   - Helps visualize the overall movement pattern of the robot snake.

3. **Speed Analysis:**
   - Shows how the velocity components vary over time.
   - Indicates acceleration and deceleration patterns during locomotion.

4. **Statistical Summary:**
   - Provides key metrics about the movement range and averages.

## Conclusions

The robot snake exhibits classic serpentine locomotion patterns with:
- Significant horizontal travel
- Pronounced vertical undulation
- Clear wave propagation from head to tail
- Different movement characteristics between the head and tail segments

The data suggests that the robot snake design successfully mimics the fundamental biomechanical principles of snake locomotion, with the head leading
