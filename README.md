# 🐍 Neurobiologically inspired control of a robot: Development and Control Strategies

This repository contains the development, design, and control strategies for a **Neurobiologically inspired control of a robot**, built as a Bachelor's thesis. The project focuses on **mechanical design, motion control, and CPG-based locomotion strategies**.

## 📖 Overview
The project explores:
- 🦴 **Hardware Design**: Modular snake-like body segments, 3D-printed joints.
- 🧠 **Control Strategies**: Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), Reinforcement Learning.
- 🎮 **Tests**: with Kinovea motion tracking.
- 🔬 **Experiments & Results**: Performance analysis, real-world testing.
