\section{Biological Snake Locomotion}
Snake locomotion has been extensively studied as a foundation for bio-inspired robotics. According to \textcite{liljeback-2013}, snake motion can be characterized by several distinct patterns, each optimized for different environmental conditions and objectives.

\subsection{Natural Snake Movement Patterns}
The primary motion patterns observed in biological snakes include:

\subsubsection{Lateral Undulation}
Lateral undulation, also known as serpentine motion, is the most common form of snake locomotion \parencite{transeth-2009}. In this pattern, the snake creates a series of smooth curves that propagate from head to tail, generating forward thrust through the interaction with ground irregularities. \textcite{liljeback-2013} describe this as a wave-like motion where the snake's body follows the path traced by its head, with each segment of the body following the same spatial curve but with a time delay.

\subsubsection{Rectilinear Motion}
This is a specialized form of locomotion used primarily by larger snakes, where the ventral scales are used to grip and release the ground in a sequential pattern \parencite{transeth-2009}. This allows for silent, straight-line movement.

\subsubsection{Sidewinding}
Sidewinding is an adaptation particularly useful on low-friction surfaces like sand. \textcite{wang2020cpg} note that this motion involves lifting portions of the body while maintaining static contact points, resulting in a distinctive diagonal movement pattern.

\subsection{Biomechanical Principles}
The effectiveness of snake locomotion relies on several key physical principles:

\subsubsection{Friction Models}
\textcite{liljeback-2013} present a detailed analysis of the anisotropic friction properties essential for snake locomotion. The difference between forward and lateral friction coefficients enables directed movement. This principle is particularly important in the design of snake robots, where artificial scales or surface treatments may be needed to replicate this effect.

\subsubsection{Propulsion Mechanics}
The generation of propulsive forces in snake locomotion involves complex interactions between the snake's body and its environment. \textcite{transeth-2009} describe how push points in the environment are used to generate forward thrust, while the continuous body deformation helps distribute forces efficiently.

\section{Snake Robots: State of the Art}

\subsection{Historical Development}
The field of snake robotics has evolved significantly since its inception. Early developments focused on mechanical implementations of serpentine motion, while modern approaches incorporate sophisticated control systems and materials \parencite{wang-2016}.

\subsection{Current Research Directions}
Contemporary research in snake robotics spans several key areas:

\subsubsection{Control Systems}
Modern control approaches increasingly utilize Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for motion generation. \textcite{wang2020cpg} demonstrate how CPG-based control systems can generate stable undulatory motion while maintaining adaptability to environmental changes. Their work shows that closed-loop control systems can significantly improve the robot's ability to maintain direction and adapt to different terrains.

\subsubsection{Materials and Construction}
Recent developments in materials science have enabled new approaches to snake robot construction. \textcite{wang-2023} present innovative work on soft robotics, using composite materials to create more flexible and adaptable snake robots. Their research demonstrates how material selection can significantly impact a robot's ability to deform and move in complex environments.

\subsubsection{Modular Design Approaches}
\textcite{wang-2016} describe the advantages of modular design in snake robots, where identical segments are connected in series. This approach simplifies manufacturing, maintenance, and control while providing flexibility in robot configuration.

\subsection{Simulation and Modeling}
The development of accurate simulation models has become increasingly important in snake robotics. \textcite{yogesh2023snake} provides implementations of various snake locomotion mechanisms in simulation, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of control strategies. These simulations help in understanding:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The effects of different gaits on locomotion efficiency
    \item The relationship between segment parameters and overall movement
    \item The impact of environmental conditions on locomotion performance
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Biologically Inspired Snake-like Robots}

Snake-like robots have gained significant attention due to their ability to navigate through challenging environments by mimicking the locomotion of biological snakes. The high degrees of freedom in their body structure enable them to traverse rough terrain, confined spaces, and even underwater environments. Various research efforts have contributed to the development of these robots, focusing on both their mechanical design and control strategies.

\paragraph{Design and Modularity}
The design of snake-like robots can vary significantly depending on their intended application. A modular approach has been widely adopted to enable flexible and adaptable locomotion. The design of a 3D-printed modular snake robot, as proposed by Mohammed et al., highlights the importance of modularity in enhancing maneuverability and scalability \cite{Mohammed2016}. Similar approaches have been explored in other studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of modular robots in performing complex tasks, such as climbing and smooth serpentine motion \cite{Bayraktaroglu2006}.

\paragraph{Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for Locomotion Control}
Inspired by biological locomotion, Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) have been extensively used in snake-like robots to generate rhythmic movements. CPGs are neural circuits that produce oscillatory signals without requiring sensory feedback, thus enabling autonomous locomotion. Several researchers have applied CPG models to control snake robots in different environments. For instance, Inoue et al. developed a CPG-based control system adaptable to varying ground friction, allowing the robot to adjust its locomotion dynamically \cite{Inoue2007}. Lu et al. proposed a cyclic inhibitory CPG model to generate 3D locomotion in a snake robot, demonstrating its capability to adapt to rough terrains \cite{Lu2006}. Similarly, Manzoor et al. designed a neural oscillator-based CPG with smooth gait transition capabilities, enabling the transition between serpentine and rectilinear locomotion \cite{manzoor-2019}.

\paragraph{Locomotion Strategies}
Different locomotion strategies have been investigated for snake-like robots, including lateral undulation, sidewinding, concertina motion, and rectilinear crawling. Lateral undulation is the most common and efficient mode of locomotion, where the robot generates sinusoidal body waves to propel itself forward \cite{liljeback-2013}. The mathematical modeling of lateral undulation has been simplified to optimize the control of snake robots, with studies showing that the forward velocity of the robot is proportional to the squared amplitude of joint oscillations \cite{liljeback-2013}. Another study by Dao and Vo focused on designing a CPG-based closed-loop control system for lateral undulation, enhancing the direction control of snake-like robots \cite{wang2020cpg}.

\paragraph{Applications and Future Directions}
Snake-like robots have numerous applications, including search and rescue operations, pipe inspection, medical applications, and exploration in hazardous environments. The development of soft robotic snake designs, such as the one proposed by Arachchige et al., offers improved adaptability by utilizing compliant materials for smooth bending and rolling locomotion \cite{Arachchige2021}. Future research in this field aims to integrate sensory feedback into CPG models, enabling real-time adaptation to environmental changes and enhancing locomotion efficiency.


\section{Neurological Models of Snake Locomotion}

The locomotion of snakes has been a subject of extensive study, revealing that their movement is governed by a complex neural system that allows for adaptive and rhythmic motion. This capability is primarily controlled by Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), neural circuits that generate rhythmic outputs without requiring sensory feedback. The study of these neurological models provides insights into the development of bio-inspired robotic locomotion.

\subsubsection{Biological Neural Control}

Biological snakes exhibit highly coordinated and adaptable movements, enabled by a hierarchical neural control system. The primary components responsible for locomotion are the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system, which work together to generate rhythmic motion patterns. It has been observed that the spinal cord alone is sufficient to generate oscillatory patterns required for movement, even in the absence of external sensory inputs, which suggests the existence of intrinsic neural oscillators \cite{Hirose2004}.

The role of sensory feedback, however, remains crucial in modifying locomotor behavior to adapt to environmental conditions. Studies indicate that proprioceptive and exteroceptive feedback modulate the activity of CPGs to refine locomotion and improve stability \cite{grillner2003motor}. These adaptive mechanisms enable snakes to switch between different gaits, such as lateral undulation, concertina locomotion, and sidewinding, depending on terrain and external perturbations \cite{transeth-2009}.

\subsubsection{Central Pattern Generator (CPG) Model}

Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are distributed neural networks that generate rhythmic motor outputs. The concept of CPGs has been widely studied in biological organisms, particularly in the context of locomotion \cite{ijspeert2008central}. A well-known example is the lamprey’s swimming pattern, which has been modeled using neural oscillators that exhibit mutually inhibitory connections \cite{ekeberg1993combined}.

For snake locomotion, CPG models typically consist of coupled oscillators arranged in a chain-like structure, similar to the segmented vertebral arrangement of a real snake. These oscillators generate phase-shifted rhythmic signals that control joint actuation in a coordinated manner. The simplest form of CPGs utilizes Matsuoka’s oscillators, which include excitatory and inhibitory neurons interacting through reciprocal inhibition \cite{matsuoka1985sustained}. More sophisticated models incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve adaptability to varying environmental conditions \cite{kimura2001adaptive}.

\subsubsection{CPG Modeling Approaches}

Several approaches have been proposed for modeling CPG-based control of snake-like robots. These can be broadly classified into the following categories:

\paragraph{Ekeberg’s Model}
Ekeberg’s model is one of the earliest neural network-based CPG models developed for controlling rhythmic locomotion. It was originally designed to simulate the swimming motion of lampreys but has been successfully adapted for snake-like locomotion \cite{ekeberg1993combined}. This model consists of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons that form a distributed network, generating smooth oscillatory outputs.

Each oscillator in Ekeberg’s model contains multiple layers of neurons, including excitatory interneurons, lateral inhibitory interneurons, and contralateral inhibitory interneurons. The interaction of these neurons produces rhythmic outputs that propagate along the structure, generating coordinated movement patterns. This model is effective in producing stable and biologically plausible motion but requires precise parameter tuning to achieve desired locomotion behaviors.

\paragraph{Matsuoka’s Model}
Matsuoka’s neural oscillator model is widely used in robotic locomotion due to its simplicity and tunability \cite{matsuoka1985sustained}. It consists of a pair of mutually inhibiting neurons, one excitatory and one inhibitory, which generate stable oscillations when appropriately parameterized. The dynamics of the Matsuoka oscillator are governed by differential equations that control the adaptive behavior of the neurons:

\begin{equation}
\frac{d x_i}{d t} = -a x_i - b y_i + c - f_i + \sum w_{ij} y_j
\end{equation}

where \( x_i \) represents the neuron’s state, \( y_i \) is the output, \( a \) and \( b \) are decay and adaptation parameters, \( f_i \) is the external input, and \( w_{ij} \) denotes the coupling weights.

Matsuoka’s model has been extensively used in CPG-based locomotion due to its ability to produce adaptable rhythmic signals. It allows for modulation of gait parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and phase relationships, making it highly suitable for robotic applications \cite{ijspeert2008central}. The model has also been enhanced to integrate sensory feedback, improving the adaptability of snake-like robots to environmental changes.

\paragraph{Mutual Inhibitory CPGs}
One of the fundamental architectures for generating rhythmic motion, the mutual inhibitory CPG model consists of neuron pairs that reciprocally inhibit each other, producing stable oscillations. This design ensures continuous rhythmic motion but lacks adaptability to varying environmental conditions \cite{matsuoka1987mechanisms}.

\paragraph{Cyclic Inhibitory CPGs}
Cyclic inhibitory CPG models incorporate feedback loops that allow oscillations to be sustained over time. These models are particularly useful for generating stable 3D locomotion, as they provide better phase synchronization across multiple joints \cite{lu2006cyclic}.

\paragraph{Sensory Feedback-Integrated CPGs}
Recent advancements in CPG modeling incorporate sensory feedback mechanisms that enable adaptive locomotion. These models use proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors to adjust the CPG parameters dynamically, allowing robots to respond to environmental stimuli \cite{inoue2004neural}.

\paragraph{Evolutionary and Learning-Based CPGs}
Machine learning and evolutionary algorithms have been applied to optimize CPG parameters for snake locomotion. By using reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, researchers have enabled robots to autonomously adapt their locomotion patterns to different terrains and obstacles \cite{ijspeert1999evolution}.

\subsection{Implementation Considerations}
When implementing CPG-based control, several key factors must be considered \parencite{wang2020cpg}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase relationships between segments
    \item Coupling strengths between oscillators
    \item Adaptation mechanisms for environmental feedback
    \item Stability of rhythm generation
\end{itemize}

These models provide a foundation for developing bio-inspired control systems that can generate smooth, coordinated motion patterns while maintaining adaptability to environmental changes.

\subsection{Mathematical Representation of CPG Networks}
The neural control system can be modeled as a network of coupled oscillators. Following \textcite{wang2020cpg}, each oscillator represents a segmental neural circuit:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \dot{x}_i &= y_i \\
    \dot{y}_i &= -\omega^2x_i + \sum_{j=1}^n k_{ij}(x_j - x_i)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i, y_i$ represent the neural activity in segment i
    \item $\omega$ is the intrinsic oscillation frequency
    \item $k_{ij}$ represents neural coupling between segments
\end{itemize}

\chapter{System Design, Implementation, and Details}

This chapter presents the complete design and implementation of the snake robot system. It covers hardware architecture and configuration, the control system and web-based interface, motion control algorithms for different locomotion modes, and an analysis of current system limitations.

\section{Hardware Architecture and Configuration}
The snake robot is built around an ESP32 microcontroller that provides central control as well as WiFi connectivity. The hardware configuration includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Control Unit:} ESP32 microcontroller for processing and wireless communications.
    \item \textbf{Actuation:} 10 servo motors drive the joints.
    \item \textbf{Servo Layout:} The servos are arranged in a specific alternating pattern:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{servoLayout = [1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]} where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{1} = Horizontal servo (7 total) for lateral bending and wave propagation.
                \item \textbf{0} = Vertical servo (3 total) for body lifting in sidewinding.
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPIO Assignments:} The designated ESP32 pins for the servos are:
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
const int servoPins[10] = {23, 22, 2, 4, 16, 17, 5, 18, 19, 21};
    \end{lstlisting}
    \item \textbf{Mechanical Design:} Modular segments with integrated servo mounts and electronics bays.
    \item \textbf{Wireless Control:} An integrated WiFi access point enables remote control.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hardware Constraints:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited servo update rate (typically 50Hz).
    \item WiFi range is approximately 50 meters.
    \item No real-time feedback from the servos regarding their actual positions.
    \item Manual calibration is required for setting the center position.
\end{itemize}

\section{Control System Architecture and Software Implementation}
The control system leverages the ESP32’s WiFi capabilities to create a web-based interface for real-time parameter adjustment and motion control.

\subsection{Core Control Parameters}
The implementation uses several configurable parameters for motion control. A representative set of parameters is:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
#define NUM_SERVOS 10

// Locomotion and direction control
bool locomotionEnabled = false;
bool forwardDirection = true;

// Motion parameters (degrees and Hz)
float amplitude = 30.0;      // Default amplitude for snake motion
float frequency = 1.0;       // Default oscillation frequency (Hz)
float phaseOffset = 60.0;    // Phase offset for wave propagation
float centerPosition = 90.0; // Neutral servo position (degrees)

// Timing (update loop interval)
unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;
const int interval = 20;     // 20 ms interval for a 50Hz update rate
\end{lstlisting}

*Note:* Earlier iterations used a 50 ms interval; the current implementation refines control with a 20 ms update for smoother motion.

\subsection{WiFi and Web Interface}
The ESP32 creates its own access point and hosts a web server to facilitate control via HTTP requests:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
WiFi.softAP("ESP32_Snake", "12345678");

// Example HTTP endpoints:
// GET /           - Returns the control interface page
// POST /?action=start    - Starts locomotion
// POST /?action=stop     - Stops locomotion
// POST /?amplitude=45    - Sets movement amplitude
// POST /?frequency=1.5   - Sets movement frequency
\end{lstlisting}

The web interface allows users to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Start/stop locomotion.
    \item Adjust amplitude, frequency, and phase parameters.
    \item Select movement modes (e.g., Lateral Undulation or Sidewinding).
    \item Initiate a servo test routine.
    \item Calibrate the center position.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameter Handling}
Parameters are updated in real time from the web interface. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void handleSetParameters() {
    if (server.hasArg("amplitude")) {
        amplitude = constrain(server.arg("amplitude").toFloat(), 10.0, 45.0);
    }
    if (server.hasArg("frequency")) {
        frequency = constrain(server.arg("frequency").toFloat(), 0.1, 2.0);
    }
    if (server.hasArg("phase")) {
        phaseOffset = constrain(server.arg("phase").toFloat(), 30.0, 90.0);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Servo Testing Functionality}
A dedicated test function cycles each servo through its range to verify proper operation:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void testServos() {
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SERVOS; i++) {
        servos[i].write(0);    // Full left position
        delay(500);
        servos[i].write(90);   // Center position
        delay(500);
        servos[i].write(180);  // Full right position
        delay(500);
        servos[i].write(90);   // Return to center
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Motion Control Algorithms}
The snake robot’s locomotion is generated by propagating sinusoidal waves along its body. Two primary movement patterns are implemented: \emph{lateral undulation} and \emph{sidewinding}.

\subsection{Lateral Undulation}
This mode uses only the horizontal servos to create an S-shaped wave for forward motion. The motion for each servo is defined by the equation:

\[
\theta_i(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi_i) + \theta_{\text{offset}}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(A\) is the amplitude (in degrees).
    \item \(\omega = 2\pi f\) with \(f\) being the oscillation frequency.
    \item \(\phi_i\) is the phase offset for the \(i\)-th servo.
    \item \(\theta_{\text{offset}}\) is the center (neutral) position.
\end{itemize}

The corresponding implementation is:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void updateServosLateralUndulation() {
    float timeScale = millis() * 0.001 * frequency * 2 * PI;
    int horizontalIndex = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SERVOS; i++) {
        if (servoLayout[i] == 1) {  // Horizontal servo
            float phase = forwardDirection ? 
                radians(horizontalIndex * phaseOffset) : 
                radians((NUM_HORIZONTAL - 1 - horizontalIndex) * phaseOffset);
            float angle = centerPosition + amplitude * sin(timeScale + phase);
            servos[i].write(angle);
            horizontalIndex++;
        } else {  // Vertical servo remains at center
            servos[i].write(centerPosition);
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Sidewinding}
Sidewinding adds vertical motion to the pattern by simultaneously controlling the vertical servos with an additional phase offset and amplitude:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void updateServosSidewinding() {
    float timeScale = millis() * 0.001 * frequency * 2 * PI;
    int horizontalIndex = 0;
    int verticalIndex = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SERVOS; i++) {
        if (servoLayout[i] == 1) {  // Horizontal servo
            float phase = forwardDirection ? 
                radians(horizontalIndex * phaseOffset) : 
                radians((NUM_HORIZONTAL - 1 - horizontalIndex) * phaseOffset);
            float angle = centerPosition + amplitude * sin(timeScale + phase);
            servos[i].write(angle);
            horizontalIndex++;
        } else {  // Vertical servo
            float phase = radians(verticalIndex * phaseOffset + verticalPhaseOffset);
            float angle = centerPosition + verticalAmplitude * sin(timeScale + phase);
            servos[i].write(angle);
            verticalIndex++;
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Notes on Implementation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{timeScale} converts elapsed time to an angular measure based on frequency.
    \item \texttt{phaseOffset} determines the progressive shift between segments.
    \item Vertical servos in sidewinding use additional parameters (\texttt{verticalAmplitude} and \texttt{verticalPhaseOffset}) for coordinated lifting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Main Control Loop}
The central update loop manages both client requests (via the web interface) and motion updates. Test routines take precedence over normal locomotion.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void loop() {
    server.handleClient();  // Process incoming web requests

    if (testingActive) {
        handleServoTest();
    } else if (locomotionEnabled && (millis() - lastUpdate >= interval)) {
        if (movementMode == 0) {
            updateServosLateralUndulation();
        } else {
            updateServosSidewinding();
        }
        lastUpdate = millis();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Movement Pattern Analysis and Current Limitations}
\subsection{Analysis of Movement Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lateral Undulation:} Creates forward motion through a progressive, sinusoidal wave along the horizontal servos. The phase difference between segments produces the characteristic S-shaped curve.
    \item \textbf{Sidewinding:} Combines a horizontal wave with a vertical component to generate a rolling, diagonal motion. The correct phase relationship between vertical and horizontal motions is critical.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Current Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Movement Constraints:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Lateral undulation may induce sideways drift.
            \item Sidewinding is limited by a fixed vertical amplitude and lacks adaptive phase relationships.
            \item Only two movement patterns are currently supported.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hardware Constraints:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Maximum update rate is constrained by the ESP32 and servo response times.
            \item WiFi range is limited to approximately 50 meters.
            \item There is no feedback mechanism from the servos, necessitating manual calibration.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
